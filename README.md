To run this game first you'll need to download the Godot Engine from this link https://godotengine.org
Next download this repository as a zip file.

When you open the Godot Engine simply drag the zip file into the application to import it.
Then you can double click on the project to open it (this is required so it can install the needed libraries, which it will do automatically after you open the project) and then click the play icon in the upper right corner.
(If you try to click run from the home page the game may not run unless it's already been opened on that machine before)

Controls:
A = Left
D = Right
W/Spacebar = Jump
esc = pause menu (only available during game)
